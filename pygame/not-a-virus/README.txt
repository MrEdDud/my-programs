NOTE: THIS IS INTENTIONALLY HORRENDOUS LOOKING

This is a really, really goofy birthday present I made for my friend with an intentionally horrible aesthetic. Apart from its looks, it also has a bug where only the top right of the images in the quiz section can be used as a button.

And no, it's not a virus, look at the code.
