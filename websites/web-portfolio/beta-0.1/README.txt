-------------------------------
- With this current version of the website, you have working buttons that lead to different pages which all have different content
or they send you to different websites. 

- However as of this moment, when you click on the pictures on the main page, you will notice that 
there is only the header and a black background. This is due to the fact that there is nothing there. I plan on adding atleast a template
on the 20/10/2023.

- Another issue is that there is a lot of template pictures and template text. For example in the about section, part of the test is copied
straight from my CV. However I plan to change this to a personilised piece of text. You also see some dummy text there which will also
be changed.

- Apart from that the website is mostly functional.
